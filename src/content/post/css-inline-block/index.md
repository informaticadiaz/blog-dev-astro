## CSS Inline Block

In this lesson we'll study about the inline-block value of the display CSS property.

`Inline` vs. `Inline-block`
Unlike the inline value the inline-block value allows us to set an element's width and height.

Also, the `inline-block` value respects the element's top and bottom padding/margin.

`block` vs. `Inline-block`
The main difference between these two is that the block value creates a line-break after the element while the inline-block does not.

It simply means elements after a block element will start on a new line while elements after an inline-block element will not.
